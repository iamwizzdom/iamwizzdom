### Hey there! 👋

I'm Wisdom, a Sr Software Engineer.

### What I Do 👨‍💻

Some years ago when I still had a life, I wrote lots of Vanilla JavaScript. But these days I specialize more in API Development using PHP and sometimes JavaScript (Node.js). However, I still work with frontend tools such as React.js, and for the sake of being versatile, I also develop mobile applications using Java or still "JavaScript" (React Native).
